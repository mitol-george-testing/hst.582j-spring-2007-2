description: 'From a former student: "I liked this class so much that I was overjoyed
  to find out that I would need a CT scan when I broke my arm. Fortunately, they gave
  me the raw data on a CD in the form of 2D slices. So I quickly searched for my Lab
  3 and processed it into a 3D model in MATLAB. It came out pretty well!" (Courtesy
